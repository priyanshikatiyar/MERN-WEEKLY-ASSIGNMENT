  <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, my name is Priyanshi, and Iâ€™m currently learning how to build webpages using HTML and CSS. It's an exciting journey where I get to combine structure and style to create something functional and beautiful.

    I belong to Kanpur, a city in Uttar Pradesh known for its leather industry and rich cultural heritage. Life here is a blend of tradition and modernity, and I feel proud to call it my hometown.
